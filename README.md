üìä Track weekly progress on the [1PPW Project Board](https://github.com/users/antoniofaical/projects)

A personal challenge to build **one project every week** throughout 2025 ‚Äî alternating between software and hardware ideas.  
Each project focuses on continuous improvement in **Python, C++, web technologies, and electronics**.

---

## Purpose

To document the journey of learning, building, and publishing consistent technical projects, from simple tools to complex systems ‚Äî while practicing:
- clean code & documentation
- version control discipline
- hardware/software integration
- creative problem-solving

---

## Methodology

Each week follows a short, iterative cycle:

1. **Ideation:** Brainstorm 3‚Äì5 potential projects based on available time and goals.  
2. **Selection:** Choose one realistic project that still pushes the learning curve.  
3. **Development:** Build within 1‚Äì2 days, keeping the code clean and modular.  
4. **Documentation:** Write a complete README, commit history, and visuals.  
5. **Publication:** Upload to GitHub and log progress on the [1PPW Project Board](https://github.com/users/antoniofaical/projects/2).

---

## Skill Focus

The challenge alternates between software and hardware projects, rotating among:
- Python scripting, APIs, and data visualization  
- C++ and Arduino prototyping  
- Front-end web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)  
- Embedded systems and electronics
